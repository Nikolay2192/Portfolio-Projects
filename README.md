This is a guide for my portfolio project that i made.
I am using Vite for my project and Visual Studio Code.
This project is using a server from the SoftUni program that i studied at.
To install all the deppendencies do as follows:
1. Open 1 terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the recipes-project folder
3. Install Vite by typing: npm install --save-dev vite
4. After it's completed install react router for the navigations in the project by typing: npm install react-router-dom
5. Then install react bootstrap by typing: npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
6. Now to run it type: npm run dev
7. Open a second terminal/command prompt for the server. Navigate to the server folder and to start it type: node server.js

Everything is ready for the testing.
